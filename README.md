  ***S.O.S Game In Java***

Overview
--------
This repository contains the Java implementation of the SOS Game, starting with the GUI for the main menu. The SOS Game is a classic paper and pencil game where the goal is to create the pattern "SOS" horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a grid. The project aims to provide a computerized version of the game, complete with a graphical user interface and Computer opponents (to be implemented).

Note: This repo currently only contains the GUI for the main menu. Game logic and other features will be added soon.

About the Repository
--------------------

This repository is being developed by Andres Medina as part of the requirements for the Computer Science 449 course, Foundations of Software Engineering. The task is to progressively update this repository throughout the semester, aiming to create a fully functional S.O.S game using Java. Eclipse serves as the IDE for development, specifically utilizing WindowBuilder and its accompanying libraries for creating the GUI. This GitHub repository serves the primary purpose of uploading files for professorial review.
