Note on Testing
---------------

As of now, JUnit tests have not been implemented in this project. Initially, I encountered challenges setting up JUnit in Eclipse, but I also believe that the current state of the project, which consists solely of a GUI for the main menu, does not lend itself to extensive testing requirements. Once JUnit testing is up and running, screenshots will be added to this section to demonstrate the testing process.
